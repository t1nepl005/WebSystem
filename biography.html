			<p>Good day everyone my name is Christine M. Lopez. Im 20 years old. Born on January 1, 2005 in Villasis Pangasinan and currently residing in Mantanas Santa Cruz Ilocos Sur. My mothers name is Jesusita Marquez and my fathers name is Roldan Lopez. I have a younger brother who is currently living in Pangasinan. I've always been a quiet soul and observant. But behind my soft spoken person lies vibrant world of creativity and ambition.</p>

				<h2>Early life and Elementary Days</h2>
				<p>During my elementary days, I was known as the shy girl, the one who preffered to stay quiet in class, and qietly observing my fellow classmates. I only play with my cousins and my brother back then. I often found comfort when I draw something in my notebooks or papers.</p>

				<h2>High School Journey:</h2>

					<p>In my High School days, not much changed at first. I was still shy, but I slowly begin to open up when my cousins invite me to go to church(home). The church has event called 'The VBS' where they teach childrens and even young peoples about the Word of God. I made a few close friend who understand my quiet nature  and appreciated me for who I was. These friendships give me the courage to step a little outside my comfort zone. It was also during this time that I began to dream of becoming a chef. I found myself fascinated by creativity behind cooking, and I imagined myself someday owning a small cafe filled with the aroma of pastries and good vibes</p>

				<h2>Senior High School Days:</h2>
				
				<p>In my Senior High School days had a different plan, I didn't end up in the culinary track like I hoped. Instead, I enrolled in the TVL-CSS strand. At first I was unsure if I can cope with the strand I was enrolled with because technology felt unfamiliar, far from my dream of the kitchen. But as the days went by, I am fascinated on how computers worked, and I realized that being in TVL-CSS strand didn't mean I had to give up my creativity, that I just had to express it in a new way.</p>

				<h2>College Life - Present:</h2>

					<p>And now as a College student pursuing the IT path, I can say that I've grown so much, still learning and exploring new things about technologies. I've also made many more friends. College didn't just give me academic knowledge, but it also gave me confidence and and life experience. And along this journey, I was blessed to meet the love of my life, someone who supports me in everything I do and sees the real me. He is also there to teach and to guide me whenever I didn't understand the lessons. I'm still holding on to the hope that I'll grow and improve more in my IT journey. It may be difficult, but I promise myself that I will overcome it. I'm studying hard not just for myself, but to someday give my parents the life they deserve.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Hobbies</h2>

				<p>Outside of academics, art is my safe space I love sketching and drawing, where I can express my emotions without needing words. Music is my another escape, I listen to it when Im sad, happy or even just bored.</p>
